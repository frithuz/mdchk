# Parser foundation contract

`internal/parser` defines an in-memory CommonMark 0.31.2 model. It recognizes no
nonempty syntax yet. The catalog is a contract for constructed fixtures and later
providers, independent of private Go layout or the future JSON projection.

## Parse outcomes

Acquire a snapshot with `NewSource(content)`, then call `Parse(ctx, source)` with
a non-nil context. Both operations stay in memory. `Source` retains arbitrary
bytes; Parse validates strict UTF-8 before any normal Markdown work. Malformed
bytes remain available through `result.Source`, with no transcoding/replacement.
Literal U+FFFD and U+0000 are valid encoding; semantic NUL substitution is not
implemented here. Encoding failure takes precedence over interruption. Rule/io
attribution, CLI exits and result-schema adaptation belong to callers.

| Input/outcome | Status / AST | Reliable data and phase progress |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nil or zero-length source | `Complete` / `Available` | Root `[0,0)`, no children, available empty reference records/lookup, both phases complete |
| Any valid nonempty source | `Incomplete` / `Partial` | Source-only root `[0,N)`, one `SyntaxUnimplemented` uncertainty over `[0,N)`, blocks pending, inlines not started; reference records/lookup unavailable |
| Invalid UTF-8 | `Failed` / `Unavailable` | Original Source, typed `Failure` with `InvalidUTF8` code and snapshot-bound byte location, nil Document, neither phase started |
| Cancellation/deadline on otherwise valid source | `Incomplete` / `Partial` | Original Source and source-only root, affected region with `Cancelled`/`DeadlineExceeded`, separate Interruption, nil Failure; unfinished work interrupted |
| Other operational failure | `Failed` / `Unavailable` | Retained Source, typed stable failure code, nil Document; synthetic model contract only at present |

Every nonempty input includes whitespace and extension/frontmatter-looking text.
Its **core interpretation is pending**; disabled extensions do not become errors.
A source-only root proves document identity and envelope, never absent syntax.
Neither nil Failure nor empty children/references proves complete parsing. No
syntax-dependent rule or fix may use uncertain regions as reliable syntax.
Interruption on empty input has the present zero-width region `[0,0)`.
Uncertainty order is start, end, reason; this foundation emits exactly one region
when incomplete. `Failure.Location` is a present, snapshot-owned zero-width point
at the first invalid scalar's leading original byte, including malformed/truncated
multibyte sequences. Its Start is the authoritative zero-based offset; byte zero
is distinct from an absent location on an unlocated/synthetic internal failure.
Public line/column conversion remains #4 and engine/io attribution remains #123.
Failure, uncertainty and interruption have typed codes so callers
never need to parse messages. `InternalFailure` is available for constructed
failure examples; Parse currently produces only `InvalidUTF8` operational failures.

For example:

```go
source := parser.NewSource([]byte("hello\n"))
result := parser.Parse(context.Background(), source)
// result.Status == parser.Incomplete; result.Failure == nil.
// result.AST == parser.Partial; root envelope is [0,6).
// result.Uncertainty[0].Reason == parser.SyntaxUnimplemented.
// An empty child list here is not evidence of an empty Markdown document.
```

The private block/reference phase precedes inline processing. Inlines cannot run
until the block phase and effective reference lookup are complete. Empty input
completes the empty registry; nonempty input leaves it unavailable and skips
inlines. Both phases receive the same caller context. Context checks currently
occur at phase boundaries, not within UTF-8 scanning or every constructor loop.
#31 owns full cancellation checkpoints, exact work metering and budget enforcement.
Its operation budget must be shared across both phases and candidate reparses,
not reset in each phase/document. No speculative budget interface is added here.

## Snapshots, spans and ownership

`Source` copies incoming bytes; `Bytes` returns an independent copy. Copies of a
Source share its snapshot identity. Independent `NewSource` calls have different
identities even for equal bytes. The zero Source is the same empty snapshot as
other zero Source values. Identity is private ownership metadata, not a random or
pointer-based output ID.

`source.Span(start,end)` validates `0 <= start <= end <= source.Len()`. Spans are
zero-based half-open original-byte ranges. Document roots span `[0,N)`; EOF is
`[N,N)`. A zero Span is **absent**; `Present()` distinguishes it from `[0,0)`.
Start/End values are meaningful only when Present is true. `source.Text(span)`
rejects absent/foreign spans and returns an immutable string view without copying
the whole document. Retaining a view can retain the snapshot backing storage.

Public `Position` means one-based physical lines and Unicode code-point columns,
tabs count as one column, and range ends are exclusive. Concrete line/CRLF/tab
mapping is #4; this foundation supplies no guessed byte-to-position conversion.

`NewNode`, `NewReferenceDefinition` and `NewDocument` validate source associations
and snapshot every mutable input layer. Their accessors return independent mutable
slices/maps/property copies and detached Node/ReferenceDefinition handles sharing
private immutable data. Replacing an exported handle cannot mutate a model that
already retained it; traversal callbacks also receive detached handles.
Use these constructors; zero Node/Document/ReferenceDefinition values are not
valid constructed models. No constructor verifies full CommonMark grammar or
claims that a constructed tree was parsed. No file/network/configuration access,
renderer, rule execution or writes occur here.

Node envelopes contain their children, markers and source-backed content/property
segments. Children, marker ranges and content segments retain source order;
equal starts keep supplied order. `Walk` uses pre-order and stops entirely when
the callback returns false. Reference definitions are separate from child traversal.

An envelope may include stripped container prefixes between content segments.
It is not permission to replace a contiguous envelope as logical text. For the
eight bytes represented by `> a\r\n> b`, the envelope is `[0,8)`, content segments
`[2,5)`/`[7,8)` select `a\r\n`/`b`, and quote prefixes occupy `[0,2)`/`[5,7)`.
The model tests construct this representation; Parse does not recognize quotes.

`Segment.Source` always selects original bytes. `Transformation` is one of:

- `Exact`: source-backed identity text; any supplied segment semantic value must
  equal that source slice.
- `Escape`, `Entity`, `Normalized`, `PartialTab`: explicit transformation from
  the source range to an optional semantic contribution; actual decoding/mapping
  is not performed by these model constructors.
- `Synthetic`, `MappingUnavailable`: explicitly synthetic content or unavailable
  mapping. A source anchor is optional; absence never claims an original slice.

`Value` retains ordered raw segments separately from optional whole semantic text.
`Optional.Present` distinguishes unknown/absent from known empty/zero values.
When all segments are Exact, a supplied whole semantic value must match their
original slices in order; differing semantic text needs explicit transformation
or unavailable/synthetic provenance. The same rule applies to node Literal/Content.
For `&amp;`, `[0,5)` selects five source bytes even when semantic text is `&`.
Never infer offsets from semantic lengths or reconstruct Markdown to locate edits.
#4/#18/#19 later populate partial-tab, inline and decoding mappings.

## Core kind and property catalog

All nodes have Kind, Envelope, ordered Markers, ordered Content segments, typed
Properties and ordered Children. A nil property pointer means absent/inapplicable;
optional scalars have explicit presence. Missing properties do not assert semantic
facts. `Properties.Literal` is optional semantic text, distinct from Content.
Roles in Markers identify source spellings; each marker has its exact source span.

| Kind | Properties / marker roles and content meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `DocumentKind` | Full snapshot envelope; ordered block children. Document owns references, while ParseResult owns availability, phases, failures and uncertainty. |
| `Paragraph` | Logical-content segments and ordered inline children. |
| `Heading` | Heading Level 1–6 and Style `atx`/`setext`; marker roles `opening`, `closing`, `underline` as applicable; content/inline children. |
| `ThematicBreak` | Marker spelling/ranges use `thematic-marker`; envelope preserves intervening spaces. |
| `BlockQuote` | Ordered block children; per-line `quote-prefix` markers. |
| `List`, `ListItem` | List.Ordered; optional Start, Delimiter (`.`/`)`), Bullet (`-`/`+`/`*`), Tight when known. Item `item-marker`/`item-prefix` ranges and ordered block children. |
| `CodeBlock` | Code.Style `indented`/`fenced`; optional Fence byte/Width, raw/semantic Info Value. `opening`, optional `closing`, `indent-prefix` markers; raw Content and semantic Literal. |
| `HTMLBlock`, `InlineHTML` | HTML.BlockForm 1–7 only for block origins; protected raw source Content. |
| `Text` | Original Content segments, semantic Literal and per-segment transformation provenance. |
| `SoftBreak`, `HardBreak` | Original line-ending Content; optional Break.Origin (`line-ending`, `spaces`, `backslash`) and `hard-break-marker` as applicable. |
| `CodeSpan` | Delimiter.Marker/backtick Width; `opening`/`closing` markers, raw Content and separately normalized Literal. |
| `Emphasis`, `Strong` | Delimiter.Marker/Width, `opening`/`closing` ranges and ordered inline children. |
| `Link`, `Image` | Link.Origin `inline`/`full`/`collapsed`/`shortcut`/`autolink`; Label/Destination/optional Title Values, optional NormalizedLabel and explicit Resolution availability. `label-open`, `label-close`, `destination-open`, `destination-close`, `title-open`, `title-close`, `image-marker` roles as applicable; label children. |

Property constructors enforce recognized kinds, property-family applicability,
basic supplied heading/fence/HTML/delimiter/origin values and all source ranges.
They do not recognize syntax, normalize labels or validate complete Markdown
grammar. Unknown facts remain absent rather than fabricated. These meanings are
internal catalog contracts; #139 owns projection/schema adaptation.

## Reference records and completion inventory

`ReferenceDefinition` stores an envelope, ordered Markers, Label/Destination/
optional Title Values and optional NormalizedLabel. Keep all definitions, including
duplicates and unused definitions, in `Document.References().Definitions` source
order. Markers use the label/destination/title roles above and `definition-colon`.
These are not rendered block children. Raw spellings and semantic values remain
separate. #17/#27 later recognize, normalize and resolve them.

Records Availability and effective LookupAvailability are independent: unavailable
data never means a proved-empty registry. Lookup maps already supplied normalized
labels to the first matching definition index. NewDocument validates indices,
first-selection consistency and coverage for an Available lookup, without doing
normalization. Partial lookup may contain only known first selections; unavailable
lookup has no entries. Mutable collection copies cannot change the document.

[`foundation.json`](testdata/commonmark/0.31.2/foundation.json) explicitly lists
all 652 upstream IDs as pending, with zero supported HTML-conformance examples.
Owners #6/#18 supply the block/inline pipelines; #5 supplies the HTML adapter and
runner, with individual syntax providers following their dependency graph. These
are foundational pending scopes, not a claim that each example uses every syntax
feature. This inventory is maintained separately from unmodified upstream data.
`TestFoundationCorpusAccounting` requires all IDs exactly once and confirms that
every actual retained input remains explicitly uncertain. Those checks are not
HTML passes. Foundation/model tests form the regression baseline; #5 and later
syntax deliveries must ratchet actual supported examples. Final completion still
requires all examples without skips/exemptions.

Run the Go build/test/vet/race and corpus checks in the contributor guide.
Current checks cannot establish syntax conformance, concrete coordinates,
reference normalization, full resource enforcement, fix safety or CLI/MCP parity.
