# CommonMark 0.31.2 corpus

This directory retains all 652 examples across 26 sections from the original
CommonMark 0.31.2 specification. It is test infrastructure; ingestion does not
establish parser, correction, GFM, or Pandoc conformance.

`upstream/` contains unmodified files from
[commonmark/commonmark-spec at 9103e341a973013013bb1a80e13567007c5cef6f](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-spec/tree/9103e341a973013013bb1a80e13567007c5cef6f).
The retained spec has SHA-256
`257c41ad946f7a1414a499aca402a1aa8fdac3678532266611348c1cf54f4b80`.
`provenance.json` records each input's origin, revision, retrieval date, size,
checksum, original Git mode, license, and role. Generator versions and generated
artifact hashes are recorded separately.

`examples.json` is the exact UTF-8 output of upstream
`test/spec_tests.py --spec <retained-spec> --dump-tests`. Do not edit it by hand.
Each record preserves `markdown`, `html`, `example`, `section`, `start_line`, and
`end_line`. IDs 1–652 are upstream identities; line fields address the upstream
specification, not a future parsed Markdown document. The extractor converts
upstream tab arrows to actual tabs in both Markdown and HTML. It preserves final
newlines in these values; example 207 has legitimate empty expected HTML. The
JSON serialization itself has no terminal newline, matching upstream output.
No HTML normalization or expected-output adaptation is applied.

Use Python 3.9 or newer, with only its standard library. From the repository root:

```sh
python3 -B tools/commonmark_corpus.py
python3 -B tools/commonmark_corpus.py --check
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tools -p 'test_commonmark_corpus.py' -v
```

Regeneration writes only `examples.json`. Check mode verifies every retained
input, independently regenerates output in memory, and compares exact fixture
bytes without writing files. It exits 0 for a match and 1 for an input,
extraction, or fixture error, with errors on stderr. After reviewing intentional
fixture edits, regenerate to replace them with the original upstream output.
For damaged retained inputs, restore the pinned original bytes; regeneration
does not download replacements or silently update provenance.
Newer Python versions may emit warnings about the unmodified upstream helper;
these remain on stderr and do not change the byte-verified generated data.

Paths are resolved relative to the tool, so from another directory use
`python3 -B /absolute/path/to/mdchk/tools/commonmark_corpus.py --check` (omit
`--check` to regenerate). Neither operation needs network access, a developer's
local spec path, a cmark executable/native library, or third-party Python
packages. The extractor imports `cmark.py` and `normalize.py` unconditionally;
both are retained, but dump mode exits before renderer construction or HTML
normalization. Tool status messages are separate from the generated JSON file.

The integration tests use disposable copies. They compare all fields to the real
upstream dump, check repeat generation from an unrelated directory, and require
non-rewriting failures for changed HTML, a removed case, corrupt retained inputs,
and a missing helper. CI runs these tests and the read-only drift check.
